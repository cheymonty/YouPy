# YouPy
A small python application I made that downloads YouTube videos 

Made using `pytube` and `tkinter`

This project is a work in progress and I will be updating the README with pictures of the GUI

I will also be updating this project with the ability to download the project and use it yourself!


# Features:
  Includes a database of all videos you have downloaded using SQL

# Future updates:
  Sanitization for input (blacklisting certain characters for names of files)

  General code clean-up
