# YouPy
A small python application I made that downloads YouTube videos 

Made using `pytube` and `tkinter`

This project is a work in progress and I will be updating the README with pictures of the GUI

I will also be updating this project with the ability to download the project and use it yourself!

# Features:
  Includes a database of all videos you have downloaded using SQL
  

# Future updates:
  Sanitization for input (blacklisting certain characters for names of files)
  
  Change path of download (currently saves to folder where youpy.py is)

  General code clean-up
